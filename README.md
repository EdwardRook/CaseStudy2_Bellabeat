## Prepare

### Data Source

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personaltracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

### Limitations

* As we will find with my analysis, the sample size is very small. Hard to draw any real trends from just 30 individuals.

* Data is from 2016, it would not useful 10 years on for analysing current trends.

* Data from the *weight* only has 8 participants and data from *heartrate_seconds* only has 14 participants. Without we have missed out on some really great opportunites to draw helpful conclusions.

## Process

I used two tools. RStudio was used to clean and organise my data. Tableau was used to create my visualisations.
